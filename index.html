				<p><a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/en">Dead by Daylight</a> is an asymetrical(4v1) horror game where players choose between two different roles. One role is the survivor where you must repair 5 generators across the map in order to power the exit gates to be able to leave. However, survivors must attempt to do this whilst the other role, the killer tries to interrupt them. Killers have special abilities such as high mobility to help chase survivors, one basic attack will make a survivor injured and a second one will put them in the dying state. When in the dying state a killer can carry the survivor to a hook and if individual survivors are hooked 3 times they will be sacrificed and will be removed from the game.</p>

				<p>In my spare time I do a bit of coding using programming languages such as <span id="languages">HTML, CSS, Javascript</span> and  <span id="languages">Python</span>. I hope that I can learn more languages and more advanced usage of the languages in my spare time to create better projects and build a portfolio for the future. I use Sublime Text 5 to write and edit my code but I plan on in the future exploring other software such as Unity.</p>
